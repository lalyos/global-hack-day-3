# Runnable Containers

This project aims to create runnable containers:

- Single-file download
- Should run on any linux
- No docker daemon is required
- Statically linked Runc is included

Use-cases include:

- Ship a Docker image based demo, which can be run without even installing Docker
- Create test databases which are just a single runnable file (no Docker daemon)
- Really create _any_ Docker image based service as single binary ... without Docker daemon

# Usage

Specify the Docker image name you want to base on.

```
./create-container alpine
```

It will create a runnable `konatiner-alpine` binary. Bring it to any linux, and start an alpine container by: `./konatiner-alpine`

## Example Runnable Conatiner fro alpine Docker image

You can try the result of the `./create-container alpine` directly from the [github release page](https://github.com/lalyos/global-hack-day-3/releases/download/v0.3/)

So here is the obligatory single-line installer (tm)
```
curl -L http://j.mp/runnable-container | tar -xz && ./kontainer-alpine
```

## Architecture ;)

- Create a statically linked runc
- Export a Docker container started from a specific image
- Create a self-extracting binary with runc, rootfs, runtime.json and config.json

## Statically linked Runc

The default [make of Runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/master/Makefile)
creates a dynamically linked binary.

The result can be downloaded: from [github release](https://github.com/sequenceiq/global-hack-day-3/releases/tag/v0.3)

- runc-0.3.tgz (https://github.com/sequenceiq/global-hack-day-3/releases/download/v0.3/runc-0.3.tgz)
- runc (https://github.com/sequenceiq/global-hack-day-3/releases/download/v0.3/runc)

Or if you want to build it yourself, the `runc-binary` subdir contains the Dockerfile, which is used for the release:
```
cd runc-binary
make build
```

## Global-hack-day-3

Iâ€™ve sent a WIP (not-working) version at the deadline, and finished it later ...
